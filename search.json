No federal fisheries currently occur in the Alaskan Arctic.\nMore information about the data and sea ice extent calculation can be found on Sea Ice Extent page.\nDownload Plot\nData Source: NOAA/NSIDC Sea Ice Concentration NSIDC Climate Data Record V4 and Near-Real-Time V2, Arctic  Statistics/Figure Source : NOAA CoastWatch PolarWatch\nmonth\nyear\n2023\n2024\nMean (1985-2015)\n\n\n\n\n1\n2023\n0.38\n0.36\n0.39\n\n\n2\n2023\n0.43\n0.41\n0.48\n\n\n3\n2023\n0.42\n0.49\n0.51\n\n\n4\n2023\n0.42\nNA\n0.46\n\n\n5\n2023\n0.28\nNA\n0.23\n\n\n6\n2023\n0.01\nNA\n0.02\n\n\n7\n2023\n0.00\nNA\n0.00\n\n\n8\n2023\n0.00\nNA\n0.00\n\n\n9\n2023\n0.00\nNA\n0.00\n\n\n10\n2023\n0.00\nNA\n0.00\n\n\n11\n2023\n0.01\nNA\n0.09\n\n\n12\n2023\n0.27\nNA\n0.27\nData Source: NOAA/NSIDC Sea Ice Concentration NSIDC Climate Data Record V4 and Near-Real-Time V2, Arctic  Statistics/Figure Source : NOAA CoastWatch PolarWatch"
